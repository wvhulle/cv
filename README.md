# Resume

This is my personal software engineer CV / resume + template.

Feel free to import the `template.typ` file (and its dependencies) for creating your own resume. It is flexible in terms of pages using a ranking system.

_Reminder for myself: always run `typst compile resume.typ` before pushing._
